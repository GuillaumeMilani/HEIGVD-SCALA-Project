# HEIG-VD SCALA Project: Clicker

Guillaume Milani, Edward Ransome, MichaÃ«l Spierer

## Description
This project is part of the SCALA course at HEIG-VD, Yverdon-les-Bains. It consists in a clicker, i.e. a game whose goal is to have as many resources as possible. In order to satisfy the latter, the player has several choices: click in a certain area to have a number of resource units, buy resources generators with resource to which create resources every second or buy bonuses to improve the two previous choices. There is a fourth way which consists in obtaining a boost of resource during a certain time and which will be unlocked by succeeding in an image recognition problem.

In addition to divert people using a funny game, this project will allow the administrator to collect information about the images the players clicked to unlock bonuses.
